# CA1_DesignPatterns
## Continuous Assessment I - Objected Oriented Design Patterns

This assignment requires the development of a Java-based application to a Database hosted on MySQL.
The app should output all records from a given database, retrieve records by name, by code(ID) and add new records into the database.

The app should be implemented using Data Access Object Pattern, used on the class access to the database itself [name of the class], in addition to 2 more creational design patters, which will be used on this application [mention both, explain why and where].

### Testing
It is required to create a CLI client program to test the implementation of the design patterns for this application.

### Submission
- .zip file with a .txt with the link to this repo.
- README.md with the explanation of the design patterns chosen on the application design.
